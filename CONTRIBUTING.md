# Contributing

Thanks for your interest! This project was concieved and built at [FOSS Hack 4.0](https://fossunited.org/fosshack/2024), a hackathon for building open-source software. As such, everything is really messy. You might be here to contribute to a template, clean up the repository or even build a new template from scratch.

## Template contributions
You can contribute to existing templates or build entirely new ones from scratch. Here's how you can do this.

### Improving a template
If you find something to improve in a template, open up it's corresponding `metadata.json` file. It will have a boolean field `accepts_contributions`. If it's `true`, feel free to open a PR. If it's not, you can volunteer to open a PR and improve it, but you won't be credited. This is because the original dev of the template doesn't want anyone else tampering with or editing their work. We, as zitefy, don't have anything to do over this.

### Building a new template
Before you get started building a template, please make sure to go through the [templating guide](). If you've done so, you can get started with this HTML.

When you're finished, simply open a PR and we'll accept it. Upon merging, it may take an hour for it to appear in the template explorer.

## Improving this repository
There are no credit issues or anything here. Simply open a PR with a neat description, and we'll merge it right away!

## Merging right now...
Right now, the evaluation for FOSS Hack is still ongoing. As such, we won't be merging any PR's until August 20, 2024. But feel free to open one, we'll merge once the evaluation finishes.
